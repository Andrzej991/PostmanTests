This is the first test script I have created on my way to become an automated test engineer. 

It is a starting point, using public API to check following aspects:

1. Get all the users
2. Create new user, check if the user is created correctly
3. Get this user data
4. Update the user by ID obtained from last get
5. Validate if the data is changed
6. Delete user and all remnants like variables
7. Ensure everything is deleted
